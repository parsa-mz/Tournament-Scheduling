This is a Divide and coquare approach for the Tournament Scheduling.

## The problem

The problem is to schedule a tournament of n teams over nâˆ’1 weeks, with each week 
divided into n/2 periods, and each period divided into two slots. The first team in 
each slot plays at home, whilst the second plays the first team away. [WIkipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament)

## Algorithm

Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all solutions to some computational 
problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates 
to the solutions, and abandons a candidate as soon as it determines that the candidate 
cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.
